/**
 * DOMAND stands for "Domain-Oriented Masking AND".
 * It is a masked computation scheme for securely performing the logical AND operation between two masked input variables
 * (x and y). The key objectives of DOMAND are:
 *
 *     Higher-Order Masking: Protects against side-channel attacks by splitting sensitive data (x and y)
 *                           into multiple shares.
 *
 *     Non-Interference: Ensures the intermediate values used in computation do not leak sensitive information, even
 *                      in the presence of higher-order adversaries.
 *
 *     Efficiency: Minimizes computational overhead while achieving leakage resilience.
